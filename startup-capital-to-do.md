## To Do List for 'Figuring out Start Up Capital'
The things in __bold__ are the things that we need to account for in our "Startup Capital" spreadsheet. Either reference them, or account for them as a tab in the document itself. The following list was blatantly stolen from [Estimate Startup Capital Cost](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/estimate-start-up-capital-starting-business-1859.html)


### Step 1
- [ ] Finish __Strategic Marketing Plan__
- [ ] Describe __Products and Service Offerings__, and strategies we intend to deploy to introduce them to the market.
- [ ] Determine when each strategy will be implemented, e.g. the schedule for advertising and what media we intend to use; aka __Ad Schedule__.

### Step 2
- [ ] Calculate product development costs.
- [ ] Consult with your vendors or suppliers (printers, advertising) and obtain estimates of what these costs will be. 
- [ ] Work out precise estimates rather than wide ranges.

### Step 3
- [ ] Prepare a __marketing budget__.
- [ ] The strategic marketing plan provides you with information about what your marketing tactics will be. 
- [ ] Attach numbers to these tasks based on consultation with the vendors in step 2 and append them to the __Ad Schedule__.

### Step 4 
- [ ] Put together a __Personnel Budget__.  Forecast the number of employees and management team members you will need for the first three years. Break this out by department so you make sure you don't overlook any functional areas.

### Step 5
- [ ] Forecast __facilities and equipment costs__. Determine how much space your venture needs to conduct operations. This can be office space, retail space, and production and warehouse space depending on the type of company. Ask real estate professionals for information about the rate per square foot for the type of space you will need. Remember to include office equipment leases in your equipment forecast, for items such as computer workstations and telephone systems.

### Step 6
- [ ] Forecast __general and administrative expenses__. These costs include items such as office supplies, travel, insurance, legal and accounting fees.

### Step 7
- [ ] Separate out the costs that will be incurred before launching the company from those that will be incurred on an ongoing basis after the company is launched. (Before Launch vs. Ongoing)

### Step 8
- [ ] Complete a __revenue forecast__. Build __financial models__ with assumptions about unit sales volume and price, and then generate a s__preadsheet with forecast revenues, month by month for the first three years__. Total up the expenses you forecast for each of these months, and calculate how long it will take for the company to reach breakeven cash flow. Total the cash deficit for these months.

### Step 9
- [ ] Compute total startup capital. Add up capital needed prior to launch and the capital required to fund the cash deficit. This is your total startup capital.
